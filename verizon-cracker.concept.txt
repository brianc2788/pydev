# web scraper idea to help with residential wifi pw cracking.
-------------------------------------------------------------
[x] create a scraper that searches the web for all 3-to-4 or 5
	letter words. To be used to generate passwords for cracking
	default passwords for verizon wifi routers. Afaik, these are
	usually around 13 chars and contain a pattern as such:

	example: word123words12345words

	could also use crunch.
	Generate possible pw by creating all possible permutations
	rather than storing a complete, plaintext wordlist. I once
	tried to generate all of these with just crunch into such
	a list and the size of the file to-be was monsterous. Also,
	maybe rainbow/hash tables.

# idea number two

[x] details, details, and more details.
