## How to use this repository ##
#### ***Subdirectories (Folders)*** ####
Contain projects of Python modules and their resources.
*Using Python version 3.6.x or greater.*

#### ***Individual Files*** ####
Python source files.
Small Python scripts where productivity trumps all-else. Because these
are *not* modules (some, however, do have objects that can be imported;
e.g. functions) they have to be run by the Python REPL or, on unix,
just run the file as-is.
